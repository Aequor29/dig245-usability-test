# A4: Usability Test w/ Bootstrap




## Instructions
Conduct a usability test and present your results in a coded page!





### Part I: Conduct a usability test (group)

1. With your group, select a website to test that is relatively-popular, either locally or [across the whole internet](https://moz.com/top500). `3 min`
1. Create a list of five realistic tasks for a user to complete on that website. For example, ask them to find specific information or perform a task. `10 min`
1. Designate someone from your group to be a test user. The test user from your group will then switch with the test user from *another* group (so that completing the five tasks is a new experience). If completing this assignment on your own then ask a roommate or friend to be your test user.
1. After switching, ask your new test user to complete each task, one at a time. Record their responses noting the following `10 min`
	1. You are testing the website, not the user. It is actually good if they make mistakes. You want to find issues!
	1. Observe your test user and make notes but do not help or interfere. Watch their eye and mouse activity (recall the [eye-tracking](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=eye+tracking+usabilty&iax=images&ia=images) experiments from presentations)
	1. Ask the user to “think aloud” to help your group understand why they are making choices.
	1. For each question, record the following:
	1. **Time**: How long does it take to complete each task?
	1. **Accuracy**: How many mistakes did they make and how fast did they recover?
	1. **Recall**: How much do they remember on multiple uses? Did they get better at using the website over time?
	1. **Emotional response**: How did they feel after using the website?



### Part II: Compile data (group)
Compile all information your group collected into a single report. Include:

1. Your name(s), a link to and screenshot of website chosen for analysis
1. List the 5 tasks you gave the user and include a discussion of the result of each. Was the user successful in completing the task? Why or why not?
1. Include a screenshot (⌘ + Shift + 4 on Mac) for each question, whether positive or negative, focussing on the element(s) of the website that led to the success or failure of the task.
1. What recommendations could you make to the website owner?
1. Use class materials on usability to inform your report.



### Part III: Prepare reports (individually)

Each group member will individually design and code their own single-page website to present the group’s information.

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your `critical-web-design` folder on your machine.
1. Design
  1. As in previous assignments, start with `designs/1.psd`.
  1. First create a wireframe, then create multiple design iterations (3+), following class [presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BiIHVEQjmIb2k2vB6N3x1g_S3KSLyZq2YCniq1ONjg8/edit?usp=sharing).
  1. Look at relevant examples of good design to help you improve your own, while prioritizing communication of your groups' findings.
  1. Research similar designs and try new things out. Use the actual content of your report in the design.
1. HTML/CSS
  1. Once you have a satisfactory design, code your design inside `index.html`.
  1. Use the Bootstrap framework and a [single page design](https://www.google.com/search?q=single+page+design) (for example [webflow.com](https://webflow.com), [humaaans.com](https://humaaans.com)).
  1. Include results, recommendations, screenshots
  1. Do not use a [Bootstrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/). The point is that you build a custom design.
  1. Save your work and commit and push changes regularly
1. Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Note: Only *your* CSS files because Bootstrap's built-in support for older browsers [will not validate](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/))
1. When finished, [publish and post your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_zmzM_eML_qkG0PaOdDRcEk3YEmbiQ1TyNnbAM08k/edit)
1. Refer to this [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1daQKCtPQCRhu2RhqHZbqBKVeJP7OcyCypLadfn14zBA/edit) for grading.
