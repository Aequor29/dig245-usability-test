# A4: Usability Test w/ Bootstrap




## Instructions
Conduct a usability test and present your results in a coded page!





- [ ] Part I: Conduct a usability test
  - [ ] With your group (3–4) select a website to test that is [relatively-popular](https://moz.com/top500). [3 min]
  - [ ] Create a list of five realistic tasks for a “test user” to complete on that website. For example, ask them to find information or perform a function. [10 min]
  - [ ] Designate someone from your group to be the test user, who should then switch with the test user from another group (so that completing the five tasks is a new experience).*
  - [ ] Give your new test user each task, one at a time. Monitor their responses while remembering the following [10 min]:
    - [ ] You are testing the website, not the user. It is actually good if they make mistakes because then you have discovered issues in the website.
    - [ ] Observe the user and make notes but do not help or interfere. Watch their eye and mouse activity (e.g. eye-tracking )
    - [ ] Ask the user to “think aloud” to understand why they make specific choices.
  - [ ] For each question, record the following:
    - [ ] Time: How long does it take to complete each task?
    - [ ] Accuracy: How many mistakes did they make and how fast did they recover?
    - [ ] Recall: How much do they remember on multiple uses? Did they get better at using the website over time?
    - [ ] Emotional response: How did they person feel about the website?



- [ ]Part II: Compile data (group)
  - [ ]Compile all information your group collected into a single document. Include:
    - [ ]Your name(s), a link to and screenshot of website chosen for analysis
    - [ ]List the 5 tasks you gave the user and include a discussion of the result of each. Was the user successful in completing the task? Why or why not?
    - [ ]Include a screenshot (⌘ + Shift + 4 on Mac) for each question, whether positive or negative, focussing on the element(s) of the website that led to the success or failure of the task.
    - [ ]What recommendations could you make to the website owner?
    - [ ]Reference relevant content from at least two usability readings








 - [ ] Fork this repository and clone it to your `critical-web-design` folder on your machine.
 - [ ] Design
   - [ ] Open `designs/1.psd` in Gimp or Photoshop
   - [ ] Using only the Type and Shape tools, recreate the design you chose
   - [ ] Your layout should fit within the Bootstrap grid layout.
   - [ ] Save your document often
   - [ ] Make new versions as needed, naming them `2.psd`, `3.psd`, etc.
 - [ ] HTML/CSS
   - [ ] Code your design inside `index.html`
   - [ ] Use only HTML and CSS to structure and style your design
   - [ ] Do not add images. Retype the text from the example you chose
   - [ ] Use the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) as well as custom CSS to create your design
   - [ ] Use CSS position, border, and translate() properties to create and rotate lines
   - [ ] Include a link to the image of the original design somewhere on the page.
   - [ ] Save your work and commit and push changes regularly
 - [ ] Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Note: Only *your* CSS files because Bootstrap's built-in support for older browsers [will not validate](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/))
 - [ ] When finished, [publish and post your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_zmzM_eML_qkG0PaOdDRcEk3YEmbiQ1TyNnbAM08k/edit)
 - [ ] Refer to this [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1daQKCtPQCRhu2RhqHZbqBKVeJP7OcyCypLadfn14zBA/edit) for grading.
