# A4: Usability Test w/ Bootstrap




## Instructions
Conduct a usability test and present your results in a coded page!





- [ ] Part I: Conduct a usability test (group)
  - [ ] With your group (3–4) select a website to test that is relatively-popular, locally or [across the whole internet](https://moz.com/top500). [3 min]
  - [ ] Create a list of five realistic tasks for a user to complete on that website. For example, ask them to find specific information or perform a task. [10 min]
  - [ ] Designate someone from your group to be a test user. The test user from your group will then switch with the test user from *another* group (so that completing the five tasks is a new experience).*
  - [ ] Give your new test user each task, one at a time. Monitor their responses while remembering the following [10 min]:
    - [ ] You are testing the website, not the user. It is actually good if they make mistakes because then you have discovered issues in the website.
    - [ ] Observe the user and make notes but do not help or interfere. Watch their eye and mouse activity (e.g. eye-tracking )
    - [ ] Ask the user to “think aloud” to understand why they make specific choices.
  - [ ] For each question, record the following:
    - [ ] **Time**: How long does it take to complete each task?
    - [ ] **Accuracy**: How many mistakes did they make and how fast did they recover?
    - [ ] **Recall**: How much do they remember on multiple uses? Did they get better at using the website over time?
    - [ ] **Emotional response**: How did they feel after using the website?
- [ ] Part II: Compile data (group)
  - [ ] Compile all information your group collected into a single document. Include:
    - [ ] Your name(s), a link to and screenshot of website chosen for analysis
    - [ ] List the 5 tasks you gave the user and include a discussion of the result of each. Was the user successful in completing the task? Why or why not?
    - [ ] Include a screenshot (⌘ + Shift + 4 on Mac) for each question, whether positive or negative, focussing on the element(s) of the website that led to the success or failure of the task.
    - [ ] What recommendations could you make to the website owner?
    - [ ] Reference relevant content from at least two usability readings
- [ ] Part III: Prepare reports (individually)
  - [ ] Each member of the group should individually design and code their own single-page website to present the group’s information.
  - [ ] Fork this repository and clone it to your `critical-web-design` folder on your machine.
  - [ ] Design
    - [ ] As in previous assignments, start with `designs/1.psd` and create multiple design iterations, looking at relevant examples of good design to help you improve your own, while prioritizing communication of your groups' findings.
    - [ ] First create a wireframe, then create multiple design iterations (3+), following the advice given in the class presentations. Research similar designs and try new things out. Use the actual content of your report in the design.
  - [ ] Code your page
    - [ ] Once you have a satisfactory design, code your design inside `index.html`. Use Twitter Bootstrap framework and a single page design (e.g. [webflow.com](https://webflow.com), [humaaans.com](https://humaaans.com)) to code your page.
  - [ ] Include results, recommendations, screenshots
  - [ ] Do not use a Bootstrap template. The point is that you build a custom design.
  - [ ] Save your work and commit and push changes regularly
  - [ ] Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Note: Only *your* CSS files because Bootstrap's built-in support for older browsers [will not validate](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/))
  - [ ] When finished, [publish and post your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_zmzM_eML_qkG0PaOdDRcEk3YEmbiQ1TyNnbAM08k/edit)
  - [ ] Refer to this [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1daQKCtPQCRhu2RhqHZbqBKVeJP7OcyCypLadfn14zBA/edit) for grading.
